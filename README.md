# Machine_failure_prediction

This project aims to predict machinery failures by leveraging machine learning algorithms, helping businesses proactively manage equipment maintenance and minimize downtime. Using a robust dataset, I implemented a Random Forest model to accurately classify failure risks based on key operational and environmental variables.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensured high-quality input data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data, resulting in improved model accuracy.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Identified and selected the most impactful features contributing to machinery failure, optimizing model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated its effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving a reliable model suitable for real-world applications.

Visualization with Power BI: Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize prediction results, offering clear insights into failure trends and risk factors
